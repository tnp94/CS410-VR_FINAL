CS 410 - Virtual Reality
2020 Fall
Final Project

This is our final project for the fall 2020 Virtual Reality class.
It is a classic style, turn based dungeon crawler. It was tested on
an Oculus Rift 2 and an HTC Vive. 

-- Instructions --
Start the game and use the pointer to start the game. You can use the
grip buttons on the right hand controller to grab items. To skip your turn,
grab the stopwatch with your right hand and press the trigger button
on the same hand to activate it. To attack, swing your sword with enough
speed at an enemy. To move, use the pointer to select an adjacent
moveable tile (it will be green) and press the grip button on the right
controller or the trigger on the left controller. To eat food, grab a
food item and bring it towards your face.

There are 3 levels, move to the stair tile to descend one level.

Right now there is functionality for the following:
	Turn based system
	Picking up items
	Skipping turn with the stopwatch
	Swinging and damaging enemies
	Enemy death
	Enemy chase player after establishing sight (no pathfinding)
	Enemy attacks the player if they are within range
	Teleporting and tile based movement
	Items leash to players position when turn is submitted
	Eating food
	Sounds associated with each turn choice
